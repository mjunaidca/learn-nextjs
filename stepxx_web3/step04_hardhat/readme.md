<h1>Hardhat Tutorial</h1>

<p>This repository is designed to help you learn Hardhat, a popular development environment for building, testing, and deploying Ethereum smart contracts. After learning the basics of HardHat, we will start learning Solidity.</p>

<h2>HardHat Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzJsC52lHBU&list=PL4Rj_WH6yLgWFFpJud2Qh4A__2RWi52B5&index=4">What is Hardhat and why use it?</a></p>

<p>Hardhat is a powerful tool for Ethereum smart contract development. It provides a streamlined workflow and a rich set of features, including a built-in development network, contract compilation, testing, debugging, and deployment capabilities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hardhat, a development environment that facilitates building on Ethereum.</li>
  <li>It helps developers manage and automate the recurring tasks that are inherent to the process of building smart contracts and dApps.</li>
  <li>And it allows you to easily introduce more functionality around this workflow. This means compiling and testing at the very core.</li>
  <li>Hardhat also comes built-in with Hardhat Network, a local Ethereum network designed for development. It allows you to deploy your contracts, run your tests, and debug your code.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Concepts to Know</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Blockchain?</strong> A public database that is updated and shared across many computers in a network.</li>
  <li><strong>Ethereum?</strong> A blockchain with a computer embedded in it. It is the foundation for building apps and organizations in a decentralized, permissionless, censorship-resistant way.</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Contracts?</strong> Application developers upload programs (reusable snippets of code) into the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) state, and users make requests to execute these code snippets with varying parameters. We call the programs smart contracts.</li>
  <li><strong>DApp?</strong> Built on a decentralized network, a DApp combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface. Backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. A DApp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language (just like an app) to make calls to its backend.</li>
</ul>
