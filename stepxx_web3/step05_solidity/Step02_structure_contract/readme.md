<h2> Structure Of Smart Contract </h2>
A contract consists of the following multiple constructs. Understanding these different facets of variables and functions is essential in order to create robust and efficient smart contracts in Solidity.

<ul>
  <li>State variables:</li>
  <li>Structure definitions</li>
  <li>Modifier definitions</li>
  <li>Event declarations</li>
  <li>Enumeration definitions</li>
  <li>Function definitions</li>
</ul>

Each facet has its specific purpose and use case, which can affect how the smart contract behaves, its security, and its gas consumption.

<h4>Remix Test.</h4>
<p> Copy the smart contract and run it in the browser Remix environment <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/">https://remix.ethereum.org/</a> </p>

<h4>Setup Local HardHat Environment With Typescript.</h4>
<p>After setting up hardhat environemnt copy the smart contract, test and deploy script then run the following commands</p>
<ol>
 <li>Compile the smart contract</li>
  <pre><code>npx hardhat compile</code></pre>
  <li>Run tests in the tests directory using the following command:</li>
  <pre><code>npx hardhat test</code></pre>
  <li>Deploy the contract using the `deploy.ts` script:</li>
    a. Setup Local Node
    <pre><code>npx hardhat node</code></pre>
    b. In new termical run the following command
  <pre><code>npx hardhat run scripts/deployFunding.ts</code></pre>
    <pre><code>npx hardhat run scripts/deployBank.ts</code></pre>

</ol>

<h3> 1. State variables:  </h3>

Not declared in a function and get updated by functions on execution. The allocated memory for a state variable is statically assigned, it cannot change permanently and they stored in a blockchain/Ethereum global state.

<code>contract SimpleStorage {
uint storedData; // State variable
// ...
}</code>

<ul>
<li> <b> internal: </b> They are defualt type and used within current contract functions and contract that inherits from it.  <code> int internal StateVariable ; </code> </li>
<li> <b> private: </b> similar to internal with additional constraints. They cannot be used even within derived contracts.  <code> int private privateStateVariable ; </code> </li>
<li> <b> public: </b>  enables external access to state variables. Compiler generates a getter function for each public state variable.  <code> int public stateIntVariable ; </code></li>
<li> <b>constant: </b> makes state variables immutable. The value must be assigned to the variable at declaration time. In fact, the compiler will replace references of this variable everywhere in code with the assigned value.   <code> bool constant hasIncome = true; </code> </li>
</ul>

<h3> 2. Structure:  </h3>

Structures or structs help implement custom user-defined data types. A structure is a composite data type, consisting of multiple variables of different data types. They are very
similar to contracts; however, they do not contain any logic within them. They consist of only variables

<pre><code>
        struct MyStruct {

        string name; //variable for type string

        uint myAge; // variable of unsigned integer type

        bool isMarried; // variable of boolean type

        uint[] bankAccountsNumbers; // variable - dynamic array of unsigned integer
}
</code></pre>

<h3> 3. MODIFIERS:  </h3>
refers to a construct that changes the behavior of code under execution. A modifier is defined using the modifier keyword followed by the modifier identifier, any parameters it should accept, and then code within the {} brackets. An underscore, _, in a modifier is a placeholder for executing the target function. You can think of this as the underscore being replaced by the target function inline. payable is an out-of-the-box modifier provided by Solidity,

<h3> 4. EVENTS:  </h3>

Events are fired from contracts so that anybody interested in them can trap/catch them and execute code in response. Events in Solidity are used primarily for informing the calling application about the current state of the contract by means of the logging facility of the EVM.

<h3> 5. ENUMERATION:  </h3>

The enum keyword is used to declare enumerations. Enumerations help in declaring a custom user-defined data type in Solidity. enum consists of an enumeration list â€“ a predetermined set of named constants.

<pre><code>
enum gender {male, female}
</code></pre>

A variable of enumeration can be declared and assigned a value, as shown in the following code:

<pre><code>gender _gender = gender.male ;</code></pre>

<h3> 6. Function:  </h3>
Functions are the executable units of code defined inside or out of contract.
A common way to define a function in Solidity is by using the function keyword, followed by a unique function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement block surrounded by curly braces.
