# Learning Solidity Essentials

In this directory we will learn solidity following <a href='https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html'> Solidity official documentation </a> and <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Solidity-Programming-Essentials-building-contracts/dp/1803231181/ref=sr_1_2_sspa'>Solidity Programming Essentials Text Book (Chapter 3 and onwards)</a>.

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state. It is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.

You can try out code examples directly in your browser with the <a href='https://remix.ethereum.org/'> Remix IDE</a>. Remix is a web browser based IDE that allows you to write, deploy and administer Solidity smart contracts, without the need to install Solidity locally.

As humans write software, it can have bugs. You should follow established software development best-practices when writing your smart contracts. Here each step will be a hardhat project including tests and deployment scripts.
